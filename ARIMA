Some notes on the ARIMA:

The SAS file contains the code used to determine the ARIMA parameters p-AR order, d-differencing order, and q-MA order
The Python (Python 3) notebook file contains the code used to fit the model and make predictions.
-The progrom begins with fitting the model on all but the last 1000 elements of the series.
-Each iteration the one step ahead prediction is computed and the next element of the series is added to the training set.
-The run time is quite long (~30 mins) due to the model being refit each iteration, however the RMSE is pretty good.
-Plots show the predicted values vs true values of the test set, and error for each element of the series.
